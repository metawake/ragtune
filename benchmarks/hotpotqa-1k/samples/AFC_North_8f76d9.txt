# AFC North

The American Football Conference North Division, or AFC North, is a division of the National Football League's (NFL) American Football Conference (AFC).  It was created as the AFC Central in 1970 following the completion of the AFL–NFL merger when two of the NFL teams—the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers—moved from the "old" NFL to join the former American Football League teams in the AFC, in order to give the two conferences an equal number of teams.  The division adopted its current name in 2002, when the league realigned divisions after expanding to 32 teams.
