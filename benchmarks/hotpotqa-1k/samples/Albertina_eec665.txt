# Albertina

The Albertina is a museum in the Innere Stadt (First District) of Vienna, Austria.  It houses one of the largest and most important print rooms in the world with approximately 65,000 drawings and approximately 1 million old master prints, as well as more modern graphic works, photographs and architectural drawings.  Apart from the graphics collection the museum has recently acquired on permanent loan two significant collections of Impressionist and early 20th-century art, some of which will be on permanent display.  The museum also houses temporary exhibitions.
